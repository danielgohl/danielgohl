- 👋 Hi, I’m @danielgohl
- 👀 I’m interested in the development of tools and applications which can address the needs of the Pre-Kindegartent thru post-graduate educational enterprise.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a lot.  In particular, how to appropriately apply trust networks, machine learning, natural language processing, and artifical intelligence to education writ large.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on development and implementation of tools, techniques, and platforms.
