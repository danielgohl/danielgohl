- 👋 Hi, I’m @danielgohl
- 👀 I’m interested in the development of tools and applications which can address the needs of the public sector agencies (state, local, higher education, & PK-12).
- 🌱 I am in a constant state of playing, exploring, and learning.  In particular, how to appropriately apply trust networks, machine learning, natural language processing, and artifical intelligence to public sector agencies and the public they serve.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on development and implementation of tools, techniques, and platforms.
- 📫 How to reach me professionally --> daniel.gohl at hp.com
